### Welcome to the main source of the project!

Here, you can find all sorts of things- Assembly, CMake, C and all those weird backend developer things that one mightn't understand.  
for starters, we have used the **ESP-IDF**, that is **Espressif IoT Development Framework** to develop this project hassle free.  
Refer to the **CHANGELOG** for more details.  

This project is programmed in **C LANGUAGE** with the **ESP-IDF TOOLCHAIN**.  
This project uses **WiFi** and **MQTT** heavily.
